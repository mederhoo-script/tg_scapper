## üìã Prerequisites

Before setting up the application, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.8+** (Python 3.10+ recommended)
- **Django 5.2+** (installed via requirements.txt)
- **Telethon 1.41+** (for Telegram API integration)
- **Pillow** (for image processing)
- **Telegram API credentials** (api_id and api_hash from https://my.telegram.org)
- **Active Telegram account(s)** with phone number access

### System Requirements
- Minimum 1GB RAM (2GB+ recommended for large groups)
- 500MB free disk space for session files and CSVs
- Stable internet connection for Telegram API access

## üöÄ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mederhoo-script/tg_scapper.git
cd tg_scapper
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Database Setup
```bash
# Run initial migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser for admin access
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 5. Initialize Default Settings (Optional)
```bash
# Load default application settings
python manage.py init_defaults
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Telegram API Setup

1. **Get API Credentials**:
   - Visit https://my.telegram.org
   - Log in with your phone number
   - Navigate to "API development tools"
   - Create a new application with any name/description
   - Note down your `api_id` (numeric) and `api_hash` (string)

2. **Security Notes**:
   - **Never share your API credentials** - they provide full access to your Telegram account
   - Store credentials securely - the app encrypts them in the database
   - Each account needs separate API credentials
   - API credentials are tied to your Telegram account, not phone numbers

### Environment Variables (Optional)

Create a `.env` file in the project root for additional configuration:

```bash
# Django Settings
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1

# Database (if using PostgreSQL instead of SQLite)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/tg_scraper

# File Storage Paths
CSV_EXPORTS_DIR=/path/to/csv/exports
TELEGRAM_SESSIONS_DIR=/path/to/sessions
MEDIA_ROOT=/path/to/media

# Security
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=False
SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER=True
SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF=True
```

## üéÆ Running the Application

### Development Server
```bash
# Start the Django development server
python manage.py runserver

# Access the application at http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Background Tasks (If Using Celery)
If you've configured Celery for background processing:

```bash
# Start Celery worker (in a separate terminal)
celery -A tg_web_scraper worker --loglevel=info

# Start Celery beat for scheduled tasks (optional)
celery -A tg_web_scraper beat --loglevel=info
```

### Production Deployment
For production, consider using:
- **Gunicorn** or **uWSGI** as WSGI server
- **Nginx** as reverse proxy
- **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** for database
- **Redis** for caching and Celery broker
- **Supervisor** for process management
